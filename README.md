# Hello JavaScript :wave:

## Project Overview
The Hello JavaScript project is just a basic website which sends alerts to a user. The application is based off of a Treehouse Tutorial which can be accessed [here](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/javascript-practice-challenge). This is also a part of my 1<sup>st</sup> round of the **100 Days of Code Challenge**.

## Inital Work
